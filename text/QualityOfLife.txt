Quality of life. I've come to dislike this term a bit. It conjures up too many images of "nice to haves." Things that aren't critical to your life, just some quality improvements.
For many chronic pain patients, "quality of life" means being able to take a shower at all or being able to walk more than a few yards. In my case, to stand for more than two to three minutes. Last but not least, the ability to work in order to provide for one's family. Many have already lost this fight and have also been denied disability to add insult to injury.
These are not mere life improvements. They are constitutional in nature. But for the government's interference, we would be able to do those things so many take for granted.
They have denied us the most fundamental promises of our constitution. By inappropriately binding the problem of illegal drugs to prescription medication, they gave those bent on opioid eradication a fig leaf to act. And in so doing, decimated countless lives in the last four years.
By using weasel words and semantics, they have diminished our suffering in the public's eye. They have accused us of deception and unsavory behavior in pursuit of some mythical high. In so doing, they have made the case that we are expendable. That sacrificing us to these policies is a worthy cause that will turn the tide on this country's drug problem. The last four years have roundly disproven this view.
In the coming months, I intend to unpack that last statement and provide evidence that the policies that sprang from the CDC's 2016 Guidelines have been a dismal failure, with heavy casualties.
