In their March 2021 paper in Pain and Therapy (link above) John F Peppin and John J Coleman trace the tangled history of errors of the US CDC, in what may reasonably be read as a persistent and deliberate attempt to inflate US data on mortality rates attributed to prescription opioids.   Although several of the errors cataloged in this paper have been reported earlier by multiple authors, I find this work to be perhaps the most inclusive and damning analysis of CDC malfeasance and deliberate misdirection in regulatory policy on opioid pain relievers. 
The summary points at the beginning of the paper are worthy of review, even if one lacks the time to read the paper for detail:
======================
Key Summary Points
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) erroneously reported prescription opioid overdose deaths in 2016 and for more than a decade before.
The error was traced to miscoding of illicitly manufactured fentanyl as prescribed fentanyl, using defined T-codes of the International Classification of Diseases.
Systemic errors begin with error-prone death certificate information provided to the CDC by state registrars of vital statistics.
Besides the fentanyl error, similar limitations were noted for other controlled substances, notably benzodiazepines, cocaine, and methadone.
Most methadone today is used for treating opioid use disorder for which it must be administered or dispensed but not prescribed, according to federal law.
Yet, the CDC characterizes all methadone-related overdose deaths as involving the prescribed version used to treat pain; thus the integrity of the CDC’s prescription drug mortality data remains in question.
The CDC was aware of the error involving fentanyl coding as early as 2005–2007 when illicitly manufactured fentanyl was noted by the CDC in more than a thousand overdose deaths in the U.S.
Yet, the CDC ignored the problem until 2016 data showed serious inconsistencies with other, more reputable, data for prescribing volumes of opioids.
In 2018, the U.S. Congress mandated the CDC to “modernize” its system for reporting drug overdose deaths but this has not yet occurred.
=========================
Taken in combination with recent revelations of the corruption of CDC internal processes which seleted the "experts" who wrote the 2016 opioid guidelines and who continue to inappropriately influence revisions, this paper offers conclusive evidence that (as I have written elsewhere) "it is time for heads to roll at the National Institute for Injury Prevention and Control"  and elsewhere in organizations affiliated with CDC.  The record of gross errors discussed in this paper can only be attributed to either incredible  incompetence or deliberate fraud.
